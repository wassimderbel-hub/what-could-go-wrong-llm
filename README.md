# What Could Go Wrong - LLM Edition

This repository hosts the files used for the What Could Go Wrong? digital card game. Nikolas Martelaro and Wendy Ju developed and presented the game at a Workshop at AutoUI 2020. The game was then modified by Nik and his team at CMU to be more generalized for AI-based systems.

The version here presents a further iteration on the game. In this iteration, prompts focus on applications of large language models. Example applications are drawn from two sources: Kaddour et al.(2023) and FlowGPT.com. The list of potential ethical issues stems from the AI4People framework (Floridi et al., 2021) and a business ethics enumeration (Baker and Comer, 2012). Besides, this iteration of the game includes a LaTeX template, which can be used to convert the digital card game into a physical card game. 

The digital card game can be loaded into and played on PlayingCards.io. Custom cards can be added using the `csv` files for `prompts` and `responses`

# Abstract

While autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly enhance our daily lives by improving safety, increasing mobility, and reducing emissions, they also introduce various challenges and potential downsides. In this workshop, our aim is to engage in meaningful discussions about the possible negative impacts of autonomous cars, to highlight concerns that need to be addressed during the design phase rather than post-deployment. To facilitate this, we will use participant position statements and group discussions, centered around a thought-provoking card game titled “What Could Go Wrong?” This innovative approach allows us to weigh the advantages of autonomous vehicles against their potential drawbacks, encouraging workshop participants and the broader AutoUI community to develop thoughtful, well-considered solutions.

## Game Setup Instructions

- Download the provided repository.
- Navigate to [https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck](https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck) to initiate a custom deck session.
- Access the virtual card table.
- Click the Edit Table icon within the green toolbar.
- Choose Room Options, then Select Import From File.
- Upload the file named "what-could-go-wrong-av.pcio".
- Click Edit Table again to conclude the editing mode and enter the gameplay mode.

## Gameplay Instructions with Wildcard Round Integration

1. All players draw 5 white cards from their stack.
2. Click the spinner to determine the first player to become the Card Czar.
3. The Card Czar pulls a black prompt card and reads it aloud to the group.
4. All other players then put 1 white response card face down in their slot.
5. **Introducing the Wildcard Round**: At a predetermined point in the game, players are allowed to play two white cards instead of one, introducing a dynamic element of strategy. This round allows for the potential to earn double points if both cards are selected by the Card Czar, encouraging deeper thought in card selection and synergy.
   
- **Activation**: The Wildcard Round is introduced at a specific, pre-announced point in the game, such as after every third round, to inject a refreshing twist.
- **Dual Play**: During this round, players are permitted to select two white cards from their hand instead of the standard single card. This challenges players to think strategically about card combinations that will resonate with the prompt and with each other.
- **Double Points Opportunity**: If the Card Czar selects a player’s combination as the most compelling, that player earns double points for the round. This raises the stakes and encourages players to engage more deeply with both the prompt and their cards.
  
6. The Card Czar reveals all submitted white cards, reading each aloud. They then select the card(s) that they find most fitting or humorous in relation to the black prompt card. +1 point (+2 in case of both the two submitted cards are chosen in wildcard round) goes to the player whose card was chosen.
7. The chosen white card sparks a group discussion, allowing players to explore further implications or humorous takes on the scenario.
8. The group engages in an extended discussion on what else could go wrong based on the chosen card. Participants can award +1 point to anyone who contributes a compelling point during the discussion.
9. After the discussion concludes, a new Card Czar is chosen via the spinner, and the "Deal" button is pressed. This ensures each player draws up to 5 cards again, preparing for the next round.


## During the game
1. Take notes on ideas that you have not thought about before
2. Some of the cards are causes, others are effects. Don’t worry about what the game designers intended with each card, go where the discussion is best.
3. Some of the cards may be upsetting. (Such as, a person is abused.)
4. It’s fine to take time to have discussion.
5. Try not to get side tracked, though!
