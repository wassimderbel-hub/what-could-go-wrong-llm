        \item All players draw 5 event cards from their stack.
        \item Use the spinner to select the Card Czar.
        \item The Card Czar reads a black prompt card to the group.
        \item Players think strategically about a card and submit it face down, or a combo in the case of the Wildcard Round, for the best match with the prompt.
        \item \textbf{Wildcard Round: Introduced at a set game point, like after every third round. Players can use two white cards for a chance at double points if both cards of one player are chosen by the Card Czar.}
        \item The Card Czar reveals and chooses the most fitting or humorous cards. Chosen cards' user earn points: +1 normally, \textbf{+2 during the Wildcard Round if both cards of one player are chosen}.
        \item Discuss the chosen cards and award +1 point for compelling contributions.
        \item After discussing, the next player becomes the Card Czar. Each player then draws new cards, so that they again have 5 cards in their hand.
